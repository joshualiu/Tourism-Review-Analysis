","Clearfield, Utah","I found Gastown a little unsettling as well. My wife and I went in the morning, and did the usual tourist stuff. In and out of their shops, but it has the look of a rundown part of town. We are from the Los Angeles area, and drug addicts and panhandlers are not an unusual sight for us. However, in...",2

",Antwerp,"Fortunately, I didn't read the bad reviews here before I went to visit Gastown. I enjoyed it a lot. I also noticed that like in any other big city, drugs are everywhere in Vancouver, and in every social class, so let's stop pretending. Homeless didn't bother me as much in Chinatown or Gastown as in other parts of the city,...",4

","San Pedro, CA","We visited Gastown mid-evening. There were loads of touristy stores with all sorts of Vancouver merchandise. There were also quite a few street people as well, though most did not bother us for money. We walked from the Lookout Tower area down to Gastown, but would recommend taking a taxi from Yaletown/BC Place areas as the streets surrounding Gastown were...",3

",Vancouver,"Gastown is the oldest part of Vancouver. Great tourist shops and bars. Set up as a tourist area in the 1970s, it is currently being renovated and is a great place to see old Vancouver. Don't miss Storeyum, an excellent museum. Don't confuse Gastown with the Downtown Eastside, which is only a few blocks away. While there are many drug...",4

Unfortunately, this is also home to the one of the worst drug cultures in North America. There are drug addicts, homeless people, and all manner of vagrancy everywhere you look. I've never seen anything like it. It was so depressing that we could...",1
